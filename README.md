The client was the owner of DriverPass, which it's a website for student drivers to register for driving courses. Users can create accounts, choose packages, take online training, complete exams, and get on-road training. The owner can also access student and employee accounts. I think I did particularly well focusing on the design requirements, which is a crucial part of creating the system. I would make sure to gather feedback from students and employers to make sure the system meets their needs and stays useful, by constatntly improving the functional and non-functional requirements. 
I had to break down the requirements from each user like the client, student, owner, and employee to understand what everyone needed and make sure the system met those needs. To design the software, I would start by gathering all the requirements for new features, then build the system with those features, then eventually I would get feedback from users, and make improvements based on that feedback to help the system working and meet user's needs.
